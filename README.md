# Hi, I'm Abdul Azeem Shaik! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Software Engineer** specializing in **Distributed Systems** at [Shardeum](https://shardeum.org/), a Layer-1 Blockchain company. My expertise lies in building scalable and efficient systems using **Rust**, **TypeScript**, and **Node.js**. I'm passionate about blockchain technology, decentralization, and scalable infrastructure, and I love connecting with like-minded individuals to discuss these topics.

With hands-on experience in Layer 0 and Layer 1 Blockchain smart contract platforms and dynamic state sharding, I am keenly interested in exploring the cutting-edge developments in the blockchain space, including:

- **ZK Proof-Based Systems**: Delving into zero-knowledge proofs for enhanced privacy and security.
- **Layer 2 Blockchains**: Understanding rollups and other scalability solutions to improve blockchain efficiency.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Innovations**: Exploring new financial models and protocols reshaping traditional finance.
- **Interoperability Solutions**: Investigating cross-chain communication to create a more interconnected blockchain ecosystem.

I welcome any opportunity to connect with others who share an interest in these areas, whether it's for collaboration, discussion, or innovation in blockchain technology.
